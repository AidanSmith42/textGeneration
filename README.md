# textGeneration
Text Generation Machine Learning

Python and keras with tensorflow as a backend to use a sample text and try and generate similar text.


Also a GPT-2 interface for interacting with open-AI's very powerful textGen model.


textGeneration.py is fun for actually training and generating off of fed in text.

gpt2.py works best for simple q/a type responses.

textGen.py doesnt use GPT2 and is just a simple neural net.  It's not good text generation, but funny to see the model try.
